<p>The MoinMoin project is developing a popular wiki engine in Python.  Wikis are getting more and more important for the communication infrastructure of OSS groups all over the world. Especially groups like Apache, Ubuntu, Python, Debian, Xen, KernelNewbies, linuxwiki.org (de), etc. are using MoinMoin to keep the contact going with their users and developers and for documentation.  We have some few long-time core developers, some more casual developers and quite many developers contributing plugin code. Additionally, many people work on the wikis improving documentation and translating it to about 40 languages.</p>
